# SQL Basics Learning Repository

Welcome to my SQL Basics Learning Repository! This repository represents my first foray into the world of SQL (Structured Query Language). The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive learning resource for beginners to understand and practice the basics of SQL language.

## Project Overview

This project is organized into several SQL files, each representing a different topic or concept in SQL. These files range from A001.sql to A025.sql and are located in the "sql" directory. Each file contains exercises or examples that help in understanding and practicing SQL queries.

## Technologies Used

The main technologies used in this project are SQL and Docker. SQL is the language being learned and practiced, while Docker is used to set up and manage the development environment.

- **SQL**: SQL is a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. It is used for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data stored in a relational database.

- **Docker**: Docker is a platform that allows developers to develop, ship, and run applications in a containerized environment. In this project, Docker is used to set up a consistent development environment.

## Repository Structure

- The root directory contains the README.md file, which provides a detailed description of the project.
- The .gitignore file is used to specify which files and directories should be ignored by version control.
- The docker-compose.yml file is used to define the Docker services and configurations for the development environment.
- The "sql" directory contains multiple SQL files which contain exercises or examples for learning SQL.
